# MBTI
About Dataset
Context
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:

Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)
Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)
Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)
Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)
(More can be learned about what these mean here)

So for example, someone who prefers introversion, intuition, thinking and perceiving would be labelled an INTP in the MBTI system, and there are lots of personality based components that would model or describe this person’s preferences or behaviour based on the label.

It is one of, if not the, the most popular personality test in the world. It is used in businesses, online, for fun, for research and lots more. A simple google search reveals all of the different ways the test has been used over time. It’s safe to say that this test is still very relevant in the world in terms of its use.

From scientific or psychological perspective it is based on the work done on cognitive functions by Carl Jung i.e. Jungian Typology. This was a model of 8 distinct functions, thought processes or ways of thinking that were suggested to be present in the mind. Later this work was transformed into several different personality systems to make it more accessible, the most popular of which is of course the MBTI.

Some basic uses could include:

Using machine learning to evaluate the MBTIs validity and ability to predict language styles and behaviour online.
Production of a machine learning algorithm that can attempt to determine a person’s personality type based on some text they have written.


Conclusions:

This was so much fun to do!
In terms of the model, we were able to handle the oversampling of data by having more examples of the less common trait
The accuracies were highest in Intuition/Sensing but lowest in Perceiving vs. Judging
